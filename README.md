"nss-todo-automation"

The test_cases.txt file has the list of API test cases, UI test scenarios and test cases.
The APICall_GETResponse.txt file is the GETResponse from the fakeAPI call.

I have implemented the API test cases and sample UI test cases using Selenium webdriver and Javascript (Automation_scripts_SeleniumWebdriver_JS)

To execute the JS scripts inside the folder /Automation_scripts_SeleniumWebdriver_JS, use the following command:
node filename.js

I have added the UI sample test scripts as well in both the folders.
