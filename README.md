"nss-todo-automation"

The test_cases.txt file has the list of API test cases, UI test scenarios and test cases.
The APICall_GETResponse.txt file is the GETResponse from the fakeAPI call.

I have implemented the API test cases and sample UI test cases using Protractor and Jasmine framework with Selenium webdriver and Javascript (Automation_scripts_ProtractorJasmine_JS)

To execute the JS scripts inside the folder /Automation_scripts_ProtractorJasmine_JS, use the following command:
protractor config.js
[Note: The above command executes all the JS scripts in that folder one after the other]

I have added the UI sample test scripts as well in both the folders.
